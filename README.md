Welcome to the **boa-restrictor** - a custom Python linter from Ambient

* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/boa-restrictor/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/ambient-innovation/boa-restrictor)
* [Full documentation](https://boa-restrictor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* Creator & Maintainer: [Ambient Digital](https://ambient.digital/)


## Rules

### Positional arguments not allowed (PBR001)

This rule enforces that functions and methods don't contain any positional arguments.

This will make refactorings easier, is more explicit,
and you avoid the [boolean bug trap](https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/07/10/python-type-hints-how-to-avoid-the-boolean-trap/).

*Wrong:*

```python
def my_func(a, b):
    pass
```

*Correct:*

```python
def my_func(*, a, b):
    pass
```

### Return type hints required if a return statement exists (PBR002)

This rule will enforce that you add a return type-hint to all methods and functions that contain a `return` statement.
This way we can be more explicit and let the IDE help the next developer because it will add warnings if you use
wrong types.

*Wrong:*

```python
def my_func(a, b):
    return a * b
```

*Correct:*

```python
def my_func(a, b) -> int:
    return a * b
```

### Avoid nested import of datetime module (PBR003)

This rule will enforce that you never import a datetime object from the datetime module, but instead import the datetime
module and get the object from there.

Since you can't distinguish in the code between a `datetime` module and `datetime` object without looking at the
imports, this leads to inconsistent and unclear code.

Importing the `date` object can cause a namespace conflict with the Django template tag `date`, therefore this is not
allowed as well.

*Wrong:*

```python
from datetime import datetime

my_datetime = datetime(2024, 9, 19)
```

*Correct:*

```python
import datetime

my_datetime = datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 19)
```

Note, that other imports from the `datetime` module like `UTC` are allowed since there are no known conflicts.

### Use dataclasses with "kw_only" (PBR004)

This rule will enforce that you use the `kw_only` parameter in every dataclass decorator.

This will force the developer to set all dataclass attributes as kwargs instead of args, which is more explicit and
easier to refactor.

*Wrong:*

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class MyDataClass:
    pass
```

*Correct:*

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass(kw_only=True)
class MyDataClass:
    pass
```

## Installation

Add the following to your .pre-commit-config.yaml file:

```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/ambient-innovation/boa-restrictor
    rev: v1.2.1
    hooks:
      - id: boa-restrictor
        args: [ --config=pyproject.toml ]
```

Now you can run the linter manually:

    pre-commit run --all-files boa-restrictor


## Configuration

### Exclude certain files

You can easily exclude certain files, for example, your tests, by using the `exclude` parameter from `pre-commit`:

```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/ambient-innovation/boa-restrictor
    rev: v1.2.1
    hooks:
      - id: boa-restrictor
        ...
        exclude: |
          (?x)^(
            /.*/tests/.*
            |.*/test_.*\.py
          )$
```

### Globally exclude configuration rule

You can disable any rule in your `pyproject.toml` file as follows:

```toml
[tool.boa-restrictor]
exclude = [
    "PBR001",
    "PBR002",
]
```

### Per-file exclusion of configuration rule

You can disable rules on a per-file-basis in your `pyproject.toml` file as follows:

```toml
[tool.boa-restrictor.per-file-excludes]
"*/tests/*" = [
    "PBR001",
    "PBR002",
]
"scripts/*" = [
    "PBR003",
]
```

Take care that the path is relative to the location of your pyproject.toml. This means that example two targets all
files living in a `scripts/` directory on the projects top level.

### Ruff support

If you are using `ruff`, you need to tell it about our linting rules. Otherwise, ruff will remove all `# noqa`
statements from your codebase.

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
# Avoiding flagging (and removing) any codes starting with `PBR` from any
# `# noqa` directives, despite Ruff's lack of support for `boa-restrictor`.
external = ["PBR"]
```

## Contribute

### Setup package for development

- Create a Python virtualenv and activate it
- Install "pip-tools" with `pip install -U pip-tools`
- Compile the requirements with `pip-compile --extra dev, -o requirements.txt pyproject.toml --resolver=backtracking`
- Sync the dependencies with your virtualenv with `pip-sync`

### Add functionality

- Create a new branch for your feature
- Change the dependency in your requirements.txt to a local (editable) one that points to your local file system:
  `-e /Users/workspace/boa-restrictor` or via pip  `pip install -e /Users/workspace/boa-restrictor`
- Ensure the code passes the tests
- Create a pull request

### Run tests

- Run tests
  ````
  pytest --ds settings tests
  ````

- Check coverage
  ````
  coverage run -m pytest tests
  coverage report -m
  ````

### Git hooks (via pre-commit)

We use pre-push hooks to ensure that only linted code reaches our remote repository and pipelines aren't triggered in
vain.

To enable the configured pre-push hooks, you need to [install](https://pre-commit.com/) pre-commit and run once:

    pre-commit install -t pre-push -t pre-commit --install-hooks

This will permanently install the git hooks for both, frontend and backend, in your local
[`.git/hooks`](./.git/hooks) folder.
The hooks are configured in the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](templates/.pre-commit-config.yaml.tpl).

You can check whether hooks work as intended using the [run](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-run) command:

    pre-commit run [hook-id] [options]

Example: run single hook

    pre-commit run ruff --all-files --hook-stage push

Example: run all hooks of pre-push stage

    pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage push

### Update documentation

- To build the documentation, run: `sphinx-build docs/ docs/_build/html/`.
- Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` to see the documentation.



### Publish to ReadTheDocs.io

- Fetch the latest changes in GitHub mirror and push them
- Trigger new build at ReadTheDocs.io (follow instructions in admin panel at RTD) if the GitHub webhook is not yet set
  up.

### Publish to PyPi

- Update documentation about new/changed functionality

- Update the `Changelog`

- Increment version in main `__init__.py`

- Create pull request / merge to main

- This project uses the flit package to publish to PyPI. Thus, publishing should be as easy as running:
  ```
  flit publish
  ```

  To publish to TestPyPI use the following to ensure that you have set up your .pypirc as
  shown [here](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upload.html#using-pypirc) and use the following command:

  ```
  flit publish --repository testpypi
  ```

### Create new version for pre-commit

To be able to use the latest version in pre-commit, you have to create a git tag for the current commit.
So please tag your commit and push it to GitHub.

### Maintenance

Please note that this package supports the [ambient-package-update](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/).
So you don't have to worry about the maintenance of this package. This updater is rendering all important
configuration and setup files. It works similar to well-known updaters like `pyupgrade` or `django-upgrade`.

To run an update, refer to the [documentation page](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/)
of the "ambient-package-update".
